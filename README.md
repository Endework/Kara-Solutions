# Building a Data Warehouse for Ethiopian Medical Businesses

This project aims to build a data warehouse to store data on Ethiopian medical businesses scraped from the web and Telegram channels. The data warehouse will be robust, scalable, and capable of handling the unique challenges associated with scraping and data collection from Telegram channels.

## Key Features
- **Data Scraping and Collection Pipeline:** Utilize the Telegram API or custom scripts to extract data from public Telegram channels relevant to Ethiopian medical businesses.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) frameworks to ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
- **Object Detection Using YOLO:** Integrate object detection capabilities using YOLO (You Only Look Once) to enhance data analysis.
- **Data Warehouse Design and Implementation:** Design and implement a data warehouse that is robust, scalable, and capable of handling the unique challenges associated with scraping and data collection from Telegram channels.
- **Data Integration and Enrichment:** Integrate and enrich the data to ensure it's ready for analysis.

## Future Work
- **Expose the Collected Data Using FastAPI:** Set up a FastAPI application and configure a database connection using SQLAlchemy. Implement CRUD operations for the database and define API endpoints using FastAPI.
